# teth todo

Todo app implemented in [**Teth**](https://github.com/jaqmol/teth) and **T.**

## What sets this one apart:

- Full Todo-MVC feature-set with just 3 conditionals
- No usage of HTML
- Very expressive:
  - Find source under `frontend/src/app` and see yourself
  - See `frontend/src/app/todo-list.ctx.js` for implementation of main features

## NEW IN 1.0.10

Teth/RPC support added for backend-messaging.

## Start with NPM
